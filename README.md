# Rails Engine

Api Creation Learning Project. First attempt at creating a Rails Backend API

# Dependencies

This app was created with Rails 5.1.6

# Setup

```bundle install
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   rails db:seed
```

# Automated Testing

I chose to give Minitest a try for Rails as I've only used Rspec

# WIP

This is a work in progress. Any and all feedback appreciated.
